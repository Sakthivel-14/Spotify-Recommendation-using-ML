Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined asÂ the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behaviour.

Algorithm:
Collaborative filtering is a technique that can filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users.
It works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set of users with tastes similar to a particular user. It looks at the items they like and combines them to create a ranked list of suggestions.
Unsupervised learning
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in data.
It is used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses.

Clustering is the most common unsupervised learning technique. 
It is used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or groupings in data. 
Applications for cluster analysis include gene sequence analysis, market research, and object recognition.

For example, if a cell phone company wants to optimize the locations where they build cell phone towers,
 they can use machine learning to estimate the number of clusters of people relying on their towers. 
A phone can only talk to one tower at a time,
 so the team uses clustering algorithms to design the best placement of cell towers to optimize signal reception for groups, or clusters, of their customers.
